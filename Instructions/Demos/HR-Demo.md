## Demos

### Copilot in Word

Let’s start by asking Copilot in Word to generate a job description.

1. Open Word (either in your browser or desktop application).

1. In the **"Describe what you'd like to write"** prompt box, type the following:

    ```text
    I'm the HR Manager at the Graphic Design Institute. We've currently started the hiring process for a new Senior Animation Designer. Please review the attached document outlining the job responsibilities for this role and generate a detailed job description based on this information.

    [copy link or reference file to Design_Team_Responsibilities.docx]
    ```

    > **NOTE:** Attach the Design_Team_Responsibilities.docx file or paste the shared link directly into the prompt to ensure Copilot has access to the relevant content.

1. After reviewing and finalizing the job description, save the document as **GDI_Job_Description.docx** and copy the shared URL for use in the next step. (Enable AutoSave and select your OneDrive account if prompted.)

### Copilot Chat

Next, we'll use Copilot Chat to compare resumes we've received to the job description and identify the best candidates.

1. Open a browser and navigate to [M365copilot.com](https://m365copilot.com/).

1. Ensure Work Mode is selected.

1. In the prompt window, type the following:

    ```text
    We are hiring for the position of Senior Animation Designer. Please analyze the attached resumes and compare them to the requirements outlined in the job description provided here: [paste link to GDI_Job_Description.docx]. Rank the candidates from most qualified to least qualified, based on their alignment with the role.

    [Resume - Patti Fernandez
    Resume - Nestor Wilke
    Resume - Holly Dickson
    Resume - Alex Wilber]
    ```

    > **NOTE:** Attach the resumes or upload them to the prompt window. Alternatively, reference each file using the shared links or filenames in your OneDrive.

1. Optionally, you can ask Copilot Chat to export its response to a Word document to highlight this feature.

### Copilot in Outlook

Lastly, use Copilot in Outlook to draft an email to the hiring team regarding the top candidates.

1. Open Outlook (either in your browser or desktop application).

1. Select **New Email**.

1. Select **Copilot** in the ribbon. From the drop-down menu, choose **Draft with Copilot**.

1. In the **"What do you want this email to say?"** prompt window, type the following:

    ```text
    Please draft an email to the hiring team to share that Nester Wilke and Patti Fernandez align best with the Senior Animation Designer role based on their qualifications. Include a recommendation to schedule interviews for these candidates and request feedback on next steps.
    ```
